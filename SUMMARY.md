**Annotated Quantitative Phase Microscopy Cell Dataset of Various Adherent Cell Lines for Segmentation Purposes** is a dataset for instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and object detection tasks. It is used in the biomedical research. 

The dataset consists of 2349 images with 21422 labeled objects belonging to 5 different classes including *PC-3*, *PNT1A*, *HOB*, and other: *A2058* and *G361*.

Images in the Annotated Quantitative Phase Microscopy Cell dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into a semantic segmentation (only one mask for every class) or object detection (bounding boxes for every object) tasks. There are 1819 (77% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *labelled* (530 images) and *unlabelled* (1819 images). The dataset was released in 2021 by the Brno University of Technology, Czech Republic and Masaryk University, Czech Republic.
