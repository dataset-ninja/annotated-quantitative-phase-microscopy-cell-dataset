**Annotated Quantitative Phase Microscopy Cell Dataset of Various Adherent Cell Lines for Segmentation Purposes** is a dataset for instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, object detection, and self supervised learning tasks. It is used in the biomedical research. 

The dataset consists of 2349 images with 21422 labeled objects belonging to 5 different classes including *PC-3*, *PNT1A*, *HOB*, and other: *A2058* and *G361*.

Images in the Annotated Quantitative Phase Microscopy Cell dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into a semantic segmentation (only one mask for every class) or object detection (bounding boxes for every object) tasks. There are 1819 (77% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *unlabelled* (1819 images) and *labelled* (530 images). The dataset was released in 2021 by the <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">Brno University of Technology, Czech Republic</span> and <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">Masaryk University, Czech Republic</span>.
