In the authors' paper, a novel U-Net-based method for robust adherent cell segmentation for quantitative phase microscopy images was designed and optimized. They meticulously crafted and assessed four specific post-processing pipelines. To enhance the method's applicability to diverse cell types, the authors employed non-deep learning transfer with adjustable parameters in the post-processing phase. Furthermore, the authors made a significant contribution by making available a new **Annotated Quantitative Phase Microscopy Cell Dataset of Various Adherent Cell Lines for Segmentation Purposes** comprising manually *labeled* images suitable for this task. Alongside this labeled dataset, they provided *unlabeled* data for self-supervised pretraining, contributing to the broader research community.

<i>Quantitative phase imaging (QPI)</i> stands as a potent tool for label-free live cell microscopy, offering images with exceptional properties for automated image processing. The authors noted that various QPI techniques have evolved over time, enabling the time-lapse observation of subtle changes in quantitative phase dynamics within cells. These dynamic changes in cell properties, as measured by QPI, have been shown to be indicative of specific cell behaviors and find applications in diverse areas such as cell motility assessment, analysis of cell content homogeneity, and evaluation of cell mass distribution. Notably, these phase-related changes can be observed without the need for cell fixation, labeling, or harvesting, preserving the inherent characteristics of the cells under study.

The authors utilized a diverse set of adherent cell lines for their research, encompassing various origins, tumorigenic potential, and morphologies, including *PC-3*, *PNT1A*, 22Rv1, DU145, LNCaP, *A2058*, A2780, Fadu, *G361*, and *HOB*. These cell lines were cultured in specific media and conditions tailored to their requirements, and the authors maintained them under controlled environmental conditions for microscopy acquisition. The QPI data was acquired using a coherence-controlled holographic microscope, with images taken at different time intervals to capture cells at varying stages of morphological changes. <i>Please Note, that cells 22Rv1, A2058, A2780, DU145, Fadu, G361, HOB and LNCaP are in the unlabelled part of the dataset</i>

The dataset curated by the authors comprises 244 labeled images of PC-3 (containing 7,907 cells), 205 labeled images of PNT1A (containing 9,288 cells), denoted as QPI_Seg_PNT1A_PC3, and 1,819 unlabeled images with a mixture of various cell lines used for pretraining. Labeling was performed using a custom MATLAB semiautomatic tool, including pre-segmentation and manual editing. The labeled data were divided into training, validation, and testing sets, while the unlabeled data was divided into training and validation subsets. Additionally, the labeled training data was employed for pretraining to augment the pretraining dataset.
